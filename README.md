Comprehensive Single Stock Market Analysis and Prediction System

Introduction & Project Overview
Welcome to the Comprehensive Single Stock Market Analysis and Prediction System. This project embodies my journey through the multifaceted world of stock market analytics, with a primary focus on extracting meaningful insights and forecasting future trends in individual stocks.

A key feature of this system is a sophisticated scoring mechanism that evaluates individual stocks, integrating financial indicators such as volume, moving averages, volatility, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) into an actionable score. Complementing this is the use of traditional statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression and ARIMA, to offer a nuanced approach to stock market analysis.

Utilizing Python and libraries such as NumPy, pandas, yfinance, along with various machine learning and statistical tools, this project spans an extensive range of analyses. From the initial stages of data collection through the intricacies of feature engineering to the application of advanced techniques in visualization and prediction, it stands as a comprehensive demonstration of data science skills applied in a practical, finance-oriented context.

Features
Data Collection: Uses yfinance to fetch historical stock data.
Feature Engineering: Implements moving averages, volatility, and momentum calculations.
Stock Market Analysis: Includes technical analysis using indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
Multi Stock Analysis: Analyzes multiple stocks for oversold conditions and potential entry points using metrics such as Volume, Moving Averages, and RSI.
Visualization: Generates plots to visualize historical trends and patterns.
Scoring System: Develops a scoring method to classify stocks based on different financial metrics.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizes Linear Regression, Random Forest, PCA for stock price prediction.
Time Series Forecasting: Implements ARIMA for future stock price predictions.

Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3.x along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
yfinance
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
statsmodels
pmdarima

You can install these packages using pip:
pip install numpy pandas yfinance matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels pmdarima

Usage
Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file.
Ensure all required libraries are installed.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to see the analysis and outputs.

Data
The project uses historical stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library. Users can input any stock symbol available on Yahoo Finance to analyze.

Methods and Models
Feature Engineering: Rolling Mean, Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Volatility calculation, etc.
Technical Analysis: Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands.
Visualization: Line charts, bar plots, and scatter plots for various financial metrics.
Scoring and Classification: Custom scoring based on financial indicators to suggest buy/sell/hold decisions.
Machine Learning: Regression models for price prediction and feature importance analysis using Random Forest.
Time Series Forecasting: ARIMA models for predicting future stock prices.

Conclusions
The system provides a detailed analysis of individual stocks, giving insights into historical performance and future trends.
The scoring mechanism offers a simplified way to interpret complex financial data.
Machine learning models demonstrate potential for predictive analytics in stock price movements.
